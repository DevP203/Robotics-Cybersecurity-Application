# Robotics-Cybersecurity-Application
This repository contains a cybersecurity analysis of an autonomous robotic vehicle project originally developed in a college engineering course. As part of my internship with the IT Security Analyst team at FIS, I revisited this project to identify potential cybersecurity risks and align them with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 controls.

üìÅ Contents:

-Project Write-Up: Overview of the robotic vehicle design and its agile development process (Word Document).
-Cybersecurity Risk Register: Threats, vulnerabilities, and risk scenarios mapped to CIA triad and ISO 27001 controls (Excel Document).
-Presentation Slides: Summary of key findings and security recommendations (PowerPoint)

üîç Key Focus Areas:

-Network and application security
-Hardware and sensor vulnerabilities
-Privacy and operational risks
-ISO/IEC 27001:2022 control alignment
T-his project demonstrates how engineering systems‚Äîeven at a prototype level‚Äîcan benefit from structured cybersecurity analysis and risk management.
